# Corporate UI Development Repository
In this repository we're developing the next generation components for Corporate UI.



## Corporate UI Component Starter

This is a starter project for building a standalone Web Component for Corporate UI using Stencil.

Stencil is also great for building entire apps. For that, use the [stencil-app-starter](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-app-starter) instead.

## Stencil

Stencil is a compiler for building fast web apps using Web Components.

Stencil combines the best concepts of the most popular frontend frameworks into a compile-time rather than run-time tool.  Stencil takes TypeScript, JSX, a tiny virtual DOM layer, efficient one-way data binding, an asynchronous rendering pipeline (similar to React Fiber), and lazy-loading out of the box, and generates 100% standards-based Web Components that run in any browser supporting the Custom Elements v1 spec.

Stencil components are just Web Components, so they work in any major framework or with no framework at all.

## Getting Started
We'll work on this section soon.

## Installation 
` npm i `

` npm start `

For demo of angular/react:

` npm run install-dep ` for installing angular/react demo
